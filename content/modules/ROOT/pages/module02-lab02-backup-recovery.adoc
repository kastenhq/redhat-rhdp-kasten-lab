_Before we can begin protecting our apps, we need to define a location for Kasten to export backup off of the cluster and primary storage._

[arabic]
. Under Policies, click _run once_ on the policy you created in lab 2, entitled _pacman-backup_
+
.Run Once

. From the bastion host, drop the `pacman` database from MongoDB that holds your highscore:
+
[source,bash]
----
export MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(oc get secret -n pacman pacman-mongodb -o jsonpath="{.data.mongodb-root-password}" | base64 --decode)
oc exec -it deploy/pacman-mongodb -n pacman -- mongosh pacman --authenticationDatabase admin -u root -p $MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD --eval 'db.dropDatabase();'
----
+
++{++: .important } ++>++ This command is simulating a data compromise event, which could be something as innocent as an administrator ++>++ accidentally dropping a table or database, or as nefarious as a ransomware attack
. Return to the Pacman tab in your browser and refresh the page. Click *High Score*. *!!OH NO YOUR HIGH SCORE IS GONE!!*
+
.no high scores

. Click the most recent backup.
+
++{++: .note } ++>++ There are two options from which to restore. The blue box is the local cluster backup, whereas the green box with the title "`Exported`" is the exported backup which is stored on our S3 ++>++ object storage. ++>++ ++>++ In the event of an accidental deletion, restoring from local cluster backup is sufficient, but if we were facing the result of a ransomware attack ++>++ we would likely want to restore from the S3 bucket. For the purposes of this lab, weâ€™ll just the local cluster backup since restore time will be slightly faster
+
Click Today, #:## in the _blue box_ to restore from the local cluster snapshot
+
.Restore Today

== Part 4. Takeaways

* Kasten automatically interrogates and detects namespaces on the cluster
* Backup jobs are configured on a per-namespace basis and can be configured quickly
* We can easily monitor actions via the Kasten UI
* We have granular control on how we restore from backup, including whether from on-cluster or exported storage
* We have granular control over which components we wish to recover and/or overwrite
