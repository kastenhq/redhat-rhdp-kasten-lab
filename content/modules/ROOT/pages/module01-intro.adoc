= Module 01 - Introduction to Veeam Kasten for OpenShift Virtualization

== 1. Introduction

This lab guide is intended to familiarize practitioners with the protection of OpenShift Virtualization workloads using *_Veeam Kasten for Kubernetes_*.
It assumes the learner is familiar with virtual machine provisioning and management in OpenShift.

== 2. How does Kasten work?

. Kasten is deployed to the cluster that it protects.
Within the cluster, Kasten communicates with the Kubernetes API server to discover applications and VMs and their resources.
. Kasten orchestrates point-in-time snapshots of complete applications, including both VM and application manifest data and storage volume data.
. Kasten exports portable copies of the point-in-time snapshot to an external object, NFS, or Veeam repository.
. If leveraging Veeam Backup & Replication as a target, file-level recovery of the VM data is also supported via the VBR console.
. Kasten has built-in capabilities to optimize backup performance when using Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (RHODF), where only changed data is transferred to the backup target, significantly reducing backup times and storage requirements.
