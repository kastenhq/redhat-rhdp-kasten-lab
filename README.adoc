= Welcome to Lab 15 - Backup/DR with Veeam Kasten K10!

== Introduction

This repository hosts the lab guide for Lab 15 - Backup/DR with Veeam Kasten.

It is designed to work with the Showroom lab environment provided by the Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP) team.

Veeam Kasten is a Kubernetes-native data protection platform designed to secure, manage, and recover containerized applications. On Red Hat OpenShift, Kasten extends its capabilities to protect both containerized workloads and traditional virtual machines (VMs), offering a unified approach to backup, disaster recovery, and application mobility. By leveraging OpenShiftâ€™s hybrid cloud infrastructure, Kasten ensures consistent data protection policies across environments, enabling organizations to meet compliance requirements and maintain business continuity with minimal operational overhead.

In this lab we will explore disaster recovery, backup and restore of Virtual Machines (Module 1) and Containers (Module 2) on OpenShift using the Veeam Kasten product.

== What Content Is Covered In The Lab?

These are the *five* main sections that will be covered:

=== Module 1 - Protecting Virtual Machines on OpenShift with Veeam Kasten

* _Installing Veeam Kasten_: In this section we will provide a review of how to install the product on any OpenShift cluster. Since the product is already installed in the lab environment this sectionwill be a review only.

* _Creating Location Profiles_: In this section, we will use setup the Kasten K10 product with a location profile to specify storage for the virtual machine backups.

* _Protecting Virtual Machines_: In this section we will perform several backup and restore operations with virtual machines.

* _Optional: Configuring Multi Cluster_: In this section you will learn how to set up Kasten Multi-Cluster Manager. Since our lab environment is a single cluster this section will be review only.

* _Optional: Migrating Workloads_: This section addresses restoring backups to different clusters. Since our lab environment is a single cluster this section will be review only.

=== Module 2 - Protecting Containerized Workloads with Veeam Kasten

* _Deploy a Sample Application_: In this section we will deploy a sample application to OpenShift.

* _Backup and Recover our Application_: In this section we will perform backup and recovery operations on the sample application.

* _Provide Application Consistent Backups via Kasten Blueprints_: In this section we will explore how to use Kasten Blueprints to provide application consistent backups of our sample application.
